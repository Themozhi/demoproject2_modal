      <h1>Pale Blue Dot~ Carl Sagan</h1>
      <p>
        Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone
        you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.
        The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic 
        doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization,
        every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor 
        and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every
        "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of
        dust suspended in a sunbeam. (You can use the escape button to exit this box too;)
